We can have Explore as an action running like a brain, which fires sub-actions:
    - normal behaviour is to move in a straight line towards the goal:
        - if it encounters an obstacle, this action cancels, and sends a message telling the brain to activate the avoidance action
            - the avoidance action turns around on the spot until it is clear of the obstacle
                - if it turns 360 degrees, halt and catch fire
            - otherwise, we need to activate a sidestep - move in the new direction until we are clear of the obstacle
                - we could use the knowledge of how far we turned to know where the obstacle is, but i think it would suffice to just keep looking in the direction of the goal?
                - the system needs to be able to activate the avoidance action recursively
                    - alternate directions of rotation so we are usually turning towards the goal?
        - once we are clear of the obstacle, turn back towards the goal and activate the move-towards-goal action again
    - once we reach the goal, set next goal and repeat.
