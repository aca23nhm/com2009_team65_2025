basic idea:

robot will continuously capture SLAM data
have the robot perform a loop:
    - in the map, go toward the nearest unexplored area, pathfind there using A* algorithm:
        - to prevent the robot running into the edge, the algo will work on an edit
        of the map where there is a 'no-go area' which extends 25-30 cm from every wall
        
        - to prevent the robot getting stuck, maybe rerun the pathfinding algo every few seconds??




big challenge:
    - safe action area of 25 cm will result in the robot being unable to go through small passages
    (as shown in the arena - some gaps are less than 45 cm but we need 50 or so)
    - mitigation: code the robot's movement commands to move about its centre (where the LIDAR sensor is)
    instead of where the wheels are
    - this would reduce the required safe action area to below 20 cm, enough to fit through small gaps
    - maybe, this would be contained in a sort of 'tight spaces mode'
    - so for most of its run, it moves at high speed and rotates normally
    - but then when traversing a tight space, it moves slowly (0.05 m/s) and is programmed to
    rotate only when stopped - about its centre, not about its wheels.
    - but how do you program it to rotate about its centre!!
